               <li>Traditional</li>\n                <p>\n                Traditional tattooing, often referred to as \"American Traditional\" or \"Old School,\" is a classic tattoo style with its roots in early 20th-century American tattoo culture. Characterized by bold, solid lines and a limited color palette, traditional tattoos typically feature iconic imagery like anchors, swallows, roses, skulls, and pin-up girls. The style is known for its simplicity, high contrast, and timeless appeal. Traditional tattoos are often chosen for their durability and ability to age well over time. This style has had a significant influence on modern tattooing and remains a popular choice among enthusiasts and artists alike.\n                </p>\n                <li>Neo Traditional</li>\n                <p>\n                Neo-Traditional tattooing is a contemporary evolution of the traditional tattoo style, blending classic elements with more intricate and modern artistic techniques. It emerged as tattoo artists sought to incorporate greater detail, shading, and a broader color palette while maintaining the bold lines and recognizable imagery of traditional tattoos. Neo-Traditional tattoos often feature realistic portraits, nature motifs, animals, and mythological themes, while incorporating elements of surrealism, watercolor-style gradients, and illustrative techniques. This style allows for a more dynamic and visually striking result, combining the nostalgia of traditional tattoos with the creativity and complexity of modern artistic expression.\n                </p>\n                <li>Japanese</li>\n                <p>  \n                The Japanese tattoo style, also known as Irezumi, has a rich history and a distinct aesthetic that dates back centuries. Rooted in Japan's cultural and artistic traditions, this style is characterized by its elaborate and intricate designs that often cover large portions of the body. Japanese tattoos frequently feature motifs from Japanese folklore, mythology, and nature, such as dragons, koi fish, cherry blossoms, geisha, samurai, and waves. Irezumi is known for its use of bold outlines, vibrant colors, and intricate shading techniques that create a sense of depth and movement within the tattoo. The designs often tell a story or convey symbolic meanings, representing concepts like strength, resilience, protection, and spirituality. The traditional process of creating Japanese tattoos involves hand-poking or hand-tapping the ink into the skin, which is a meticulous and time-consuming method. \n                </p>\n                <li>Tribal</li>\n                <p>\n                Tribal tattooing is a style inspired by the ancient tattoo traditions of various indigenous cultures around the world. It often features bold, black ink designs with sharp edges and abstract patterns. Tribal tattoos are known for their emphasis on lines, geometric shapes, and symmetry. These designs can be simple or complex, ranging from minimalist lines to intricate interwoven patterns. It's important to note that the term \"tribal\" can be controversial, as it oversimplifies and homogenizes the diverse tattoo practices of indigenous cultures.    \n                </p>\n                <li>Biomech</li>\n                <p>\n                Bio-mechanical tattoos are a unique and futuristic tattoo style that combines elements of biology and mechanics. Inspired by the merging of human anatomy and machinery, bio-mech tattoos often depict intricate designs that give the illusion of the skin being peeled back to reveal mechanical parts beneath. These designs incorporate details like gears, pistons, wires, and circuitry, seamlessly integrated with organic elements like muscles, tendons, bones, or other non human biological feature.  \n                </p>\n                <li>Fineline/Black & Grey</li>\n                <p>\n                Fine line black and grey tattoos are a minimalist tattoo style that focuses on intricate details, and subtle shading. These tattoos are characterized by their use of thin, delicate lines and varying shades of black and grey ink to create depth, contrast, and realism. Artists who specialize in this style often use techniques such as stippling, hatching, and cross-hatching to achieve different levels of shading and texture. It is worth nothing that any of these other genres of tattoo can be applied with only black and grey but fine line is a specific form into its-self.    \n                </p>\n                <li>Hand Poke</li>\n                <p>\n                 Hand poke like black and grey can take the form of any style but is functionally different in application. Hand poke is done without the use of electric machines and relies on the artist individually poking in ink. The advent of the electric machine for tattooing is a recent invention in the historical framework of tattooing and many tribal or folk styles still depend on this tradition.    \n                </p>\n                <li>New School</li>\n                <p>\n                New School tattooing is a vibrant and playful tattoo style that emerged in the late 20th century as a departure from traditional and conventional designs. This style is characterized by its bold and exaggerated imagery, use of bright and bold colors, exaggerated proportions, and a cartoon-like aesthetic. New School tattoos often feature subjects like caricatures of animals, fictional characters, pop culture references, and surreal scenes.\n                </p>\n                <li>Other</li>\n                <p>\n                The above styles are some of the main types of tattoos, but there are plenty of others that are capable of being defined, or crossover between styles.     \n                </p>\n            </ul>\n            <h3>Things to look for/Thing to avoid</h3>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Linework</li>\n                <p>\n                Line work is one of the most important aspects of a tattoo. Straight and consistent thickness of the line is what you want to look for. Shaky or inconsistent lines are signs of poor application/technique. \"Blowouts\" are one of the main things to look for when deciding if an artist is a good tattooer. when the needle penetrates into a deeper layer of tissue than what is wanted the ink can spread a but and create a shadow effect along the line. Blowouts can occur without application error, and different places on the body are more prone to them, but consistent blowouts on an artists profile would be something to watch out for. \n                </p>\n                <li>Shading</li>\n                <p>\n                Shading consistency is also one of the key elements to look for in a tattoo/artist. There are styles without shading, but most employee shading to some degree. Smooth transitions from dark to light and a rich dark tone for the blacks and a fade to no ink is generally the desired application. Patchy blackwork or color can be hard to fix, and an absence of color called a \"holiday\" is an indication of poor technique/application.  \n                </p>\n                <li>Palete</li>\n                <p>\n                 The main thing to look for with palate is personal preference. If you like bright colors find an artist that goes for that. The main thing to consider is if you are looking for a specific style that the palate matches what you want. If an artist uses a wide range of colors with great color theory thats great, but maybe not if you want a purely traditional style.     \n                </p>\n            </ul>\n            <h3>Etiquette</h3>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Communication</li>\n                <p>\n                Different artists communicate differently both in setting up an appointment and tattoo design. Some artists will only tattoo \"Flash\" which is imagery they have designed and have ready to go. Some artists will only tattoo a specific design once, whereas others will repeat one of their designs. Other artists will do custom work or even specialize with reproduction of other work from a tattoo or non tattoo medium. If there is an artist you like try to determine that what you want is what they also like to do, and have the appropriate amount of information for them so they don’t need to ask every single questions they might have. How big do you want it, where do you want it, what is your time availability, do you have other tattoos, and maybe what your budget in are often preliminary information that will help your artist get you on their list. Some artists have long waitlists lasting months or even years so patience is key. Most artists communicate themselves so often long periods of non communication are common as they don’t always stay on top of emails.     \n                </p>\n                <li>Day of getting your tattoo</li>\n                <p>\n                It is important to have a good sized meal beforehand as getting a tattoo can be taxing on the body. It is also important to be hydrated and very important for both of you to not be under the weather. Being drunk or otherwise impaired is a horrible idea, both for practical life reasons, but also because alcohol will thin your blood and make you bleed/bruise more easily.     \n                </p>\n                <li>Tip</li>\n                <p>\n                Treat tipping like you would at a nice restaurant. 15-20% is a normal amount, but also you could just do a flat amount based on how much time you spent, how much money you spent, or how good you felt about the experience. If you plan on getting tattooed out of the US then its worth using google to search for specific local tipping customs although tattoos can buck local trends.     \n                </p>\n             </ul>\n        </section>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Tips;\n\n","C:\\Users\\jaswi\\Desktop\\UCB\\linework\\client\\src\\components\\InspoPage\\InspoPage.js",[],"C:\\Users\\jaswi\\Desktop\\UCB\\linework\\client\\src\\utils\\mutations.js",[],"C:\\Users\\jaswi\\Desktop\\UCB\\linework\\client\\src\\utils\\auth.js",["71"],"import decode from 'jwt-decode';\nclass AuthService {\n  getProfile() {\n    return decode(this.getToken());\n  }\n  loggedIn() {\n    const token = this.getToken();\n    return token && !this.isTokenExpired(token) ? true : false;\n  }\n  isTokenExpired(token) {\n    const decoded = decode(token);\n    if (decoded.exp < Date.now() / 1000) {\n      localStorage.removeItem('id_token');\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n  getToken() {\n    return localStorage.getItem('id_token');\n  }\n  login(idToken) {\n    localStorage.setItem('id_token', idToken);\n    window.location.assign('/');\n  }\n  logout() {\n    localStorage.removeItem('id_token');\n    window.location.reload();\n  }\n}\nexport default new AuthService();",{"ruleId":"72","replacedBy":"73"},{"ruleId":"74","replacedBy":"75"},{"ruleId":"76","severity":1,"message":"77","line":4,"column":10,"nodeType":"78","messageId":"79","endLine":4,"endColumn":23},{"ruleId":"76","severity":1,"message":"80","line":5,"column":10,"nodeType":"78","messageId":"79","endLine":5,"endColumn":30},{"ruleId":"81","severity":1,"message":"82","line":112,"column":6,"nodeType":"83","endLine":112,"endColumn":8,"suggestions":"84"},{"ruleId":"76","severity":1,"message":"85","line":2,"column":10,"nodeType":"78","messageId":"79","endLine":2,"endColumn":16},{"ruleId":"76","severity":1,"message":"86","line":2,"column":18,"nodeType":"78","messageId":"79","endLine":2,"endColumn":22},{"ruleId":"76","severity":1,"message":"87","line":15,"column":21,"nodeType":"78","messageId":"79","endLine":15,"endColumn":26},{"ruleId":"76","severity":1,"message":"87","line":10,"column":19,"nodeType":"78","messageId":"79","endLine":10,"endColumn":24},{"ruleId":"76","severity":1,"message":"88","line":10,"column":26,"nodeType":"78","messageId":"79","endLine":10,"endColumn":30},{"ruleId":"76","severity":1,"message":"85","line":2,"column":10,"nodeType":"78","messageId":"79","endLine":2,"endColumn":16},{"ruleId":"76","severity":1,"message":"86","line":2,"column":18,"nodeType":"78","messageId":"79","endLine":2,"endColumn":22},{"ruleId":"89","severity":1,"message":"90","line":30,"column":1,"nodeType":"91","endLine":30,"endColumn":34},"no-native-reassign",["92"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["93"],"no-unused-vars","'selectedPlace' is assigned a value but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","'selectedPlaceDetails' is assigned a value but never used.","react-hooks/exhaustive-deps","React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'googleApiKey'.
